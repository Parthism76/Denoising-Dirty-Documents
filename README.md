Denoising Dirty Documents

Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the process of denoising dirty documents using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). The project focuses on image denoising techniques to enhance the clarity and readability of scanned or noisy documents.

Project Details

Technique Used: Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)

Dataset: A collection of noisy scanned documents

Libraries Used: OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib

Objective: To apply SVD-based image processing to reduce noise and improve document quality

Installation

To run the notebook, ensure you have the required dependencies installed:

pip install numpy opencv-python matplotlib

Usage

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/Denoising_Dirty_Documents.git
cd Denoising_Dirty_Documents

Open the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook Denoising_Dirty_Documents.ipynb

Execute the cells to preprocess and denoise document images.

Results

The notebook includes visualizations comparing the original and denoised documents, demonstrating the effectiveness of SVD in noise reduction.

Contributing

Feel free to contribute by suggesting improvements, optimizing the algorithm, or testing with different datasets.
